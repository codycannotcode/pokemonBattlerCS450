In order to correctly run the rl_model_training script to create and train Pokemon models, you must install and run a local Pokemon Showdown server.

Follow the section titled Configuring a Pok√©mon Showdown Server in the poke-env docs:
https://poke-env.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html#configuring-a-pokemon-showdown-server

Then install the correct dependencies (you should use a virtual environment!) using
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
